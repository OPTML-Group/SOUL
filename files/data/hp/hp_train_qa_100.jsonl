Sitting on top of Mr Weasley\u2019s overflowing in tray was an old toaster that was hiccuping in a disconsolate way and a pair of empty leather gloves that were twiddling their thumbs . A photograph of the Weasley family stood beside the in tray . Harry noticed that Percy appeared to have walked out of it . \u201c We haven\u2019t got a window , \u201d said Mr Weasley apologetically , taking off his bomber jacket and placing it on the back of his chair . \u201c We\u2019ve asked , but they don\u2019t seem to think we need one .

Sitting near the lake , watching the giant squid waving its tentacles lazily above the water , Harry lost the thread of the conversation as he looked across to the opposite bank . The stag had galloped toward him from there just last night . A shadow fell across them and they looked up to see a very bleary eyed Hagrid , mopping his sweaty face with one of his tablecloth sized handkerchiefs and beaming down at them . \u201c Know I shouldn \u2019 feel happy , after wha \u2019 happened las \u2019 night , \u201d he said . \u201c I mean , Black escapin \u2019 again , an \u2019 everythin \u2019 but guess what ? \u201d \u201c What ? \u201d they said , pretending to look curious . \u201c Beaky !

There was a lot more to magic , as Harry quickly found out , than waving your wand and saying a few funny words . They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets . Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology , with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout , where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi , and found out what they were used for . Easily the most boring class was History of Magic , which was the only one taught by a ghost . Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach , leaving his body behind him . Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates , and got Emeric the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up . Professor Flitwick , the Charms teacher , was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk ."}

Their son , Harry , remains the only wizard ever to have survived the Killing Curse .

Aunt Marge lived in the country , in a house with a large garden , where she bred bulldogs .

At Dudley\u2019s fifth birthday party , Aunt Marge had whacked Harry around the shins with her walking stick to stop him from beating Dudley at musical statues . A few years later , she had turned up at Christmas with a computerized robot for Dudley and a box of dog biscuits for Harry . On her last visit , the year before Harry started at Hogwarts , Harry had accidentally trodden on the tail of her favorite dog . Ripper had chased Harry out into the garden and up a tree , and Aunt Marge had refused to call him off until past midnight . The memory of this incident still brought tears of laughter to Dudley\u2019s eyes . \u201c Marge\u2019ll be here for a week , \u201d Uncle Vernon snarled , \u201c and while we\u2019re on the subject \u201d he pointed a fat finger threateningly at Harry \u201c we need to get a few things straight before I go and collect her . \u201d Dudley smirked and withdrew his gaze from the television .

Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach , leaving his body behind him . Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates , and got Emeric the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up .

He tapped Ginny on the shoulder . \u201c Fancy trying to find a compartment ? \u201d \u201c I can\u2019t , Harry , I said I\u2019d meet Dean , \u201d said Ginny brightly . \u201c See you later . \u201d \u201c Right , \u201d said Harry ."}
{"prompt": "Can you extend this sentence further: Even by Harry\u2019s low standards in Divination , the exam went very badly . He might as well have tried to see moving pictures in the desktop as in the stubbornly blank crystal ball he lost his head completely during tea leaf reading , saying it looked to him as though Professor Marchbanks would shortly be meeting a round , dark , soggy stranger , and rounded off the whole fiasco by mixing up the life and head lines on her palm and informing her that she ought to have died the previous Tuesday . \u201c Well , we were", "response": "always going to fail that one , \u201d said Ron gloomily as they ascended the marble staircase . He had just made Harry feel rather better by telling him how he told the examiner in detail about the ugly man with a wart on his nose in his crystal ball , only to look up and realize he had been describing his examiner\u2019s reflection . \u201c We shouldn\u2019t have taken the stupid subject in the first place , \u201d said Harry . \u201c Still , at least we can give it up now . \u201d \u201c Yeah , \u201d said Harry . \u201c No more pretending we care what happens when Jupiter and Uranus get too friendly \u201d \u201c And from now on , I don\u2019t care if my tea leaves spell die , Ron , die I\u2019m just chucking them in the bin where they belong . \u201d Harry laughed just as Hermione came running up behind them . He stopped laughing at once , in case it annoyed her . \u201c Well , I think I\u2019ve done all right in Arithmancy , \u201d she said , and Harry and Ron both sighed with relief . \u201c Just time for a quick look over our star charts before dinner , then \u201d When they reached the top of the Astronomy Tower at eleven o\u2019clock they found a perfect night for stargazing , cloudless and still . The grounds were bathed in silvery moonlight , and there was a slight chill in the air . Each of them set up his or her telescope and , when Professor Marchbanks gave the word , proceeded to fill in the blank star chart he or she had been given . Professors Marchbanks and Tofty strolled among them , watching as they entered the precise positions of the stars and planets they were observing ."}
{"prompt": "Can you extend this sentence further: said Hermione ) \u201c I must once more ask for your attention , while I give out a few notices . \u201c Mr Filch , the caretaker , has asked me to tell you that the list of objects forbidden inside the castle has this year been extended to include Screaming Yo yos , Fanged Frisbees , and Ever Bashing Boomerangs .

He looked around at Fred and George , his fellow members of the Quidditch team . They were mouthing soundlessly at Dumbledore , apparently too appalled to speak . Dumbledore went on , \u201c This is due to an event that will be starting in October , and continuing throughout the school year , taking up much of the teachers \u2019 time and energy but I am sure you will all enjoy it immensely .

A man stood in the doorway , leaning upon a long staff , shrouded in a black traveling cloak . Every head in the Great Hall swiveled toward the stranger , suddenly brightly illuminated by a fork of lightning that flashed across the ceiling . He lowered his hood , shook out a long mane of grizzled , dark gray hair , then began to walk up toward the teachers \u2019 table . A dull clunk echoed through the Hall on his every other step . He reached the end of the top table , turned right , and limped heavily toward Dumbledore . Another flash of lightning crossed the ceiling . Hermione gasped ."}
{"prompt": "Can you extend this sentence further: \u201c As we Disapparated , Yaxley caught hold of me and I couldn\u2019t get rid of him , he was too strong , and he was still holding on when we arrived at Grimmauld Place , and then well , I think he must have seen the door , and thought we were stopping there , so he slackened his grip and I managed to shake him off and I brought us here instead ! \u201d \u201c But then , where\u2019s he ?

Gloomy and oppressive though the house was , it had been their one safe refuge : even , now that Kreacher was so much happier and friendlier , a kind of home . With a twinge of regret that had nothing to do with food , Harry imagined the house elf busying himself over the steak and kidney pie that Harry , Ron , and Hermione would never eat . \u201c Harry , I\u2019m sorry , I\u2019m so sorry ! \u201d \u201c Don\u2019t be stupid , it wasn\u2019t your fault !
